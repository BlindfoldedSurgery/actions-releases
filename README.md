# actions-releases

This repository contains a set of reusable workflows geared towards supporting the release process
of a versioned project.

The project follows semantic versioning. You can depend on tags for specific versions of use a
major version tag (e.g. `v1`).

Every commit on the main branch leads to a new release. Releases are managed by
[commitizen][commitizen], which relies on [conventional commits][ccommit]. To make sure you don't
accidentally create commits with an unconventional message, install a pre-commit hook using
`make pre-commit`.

[ccommit]: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
